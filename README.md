This is the calculator project for The Odin Project, It is the final project in the foundations course! I will be doing my absolute best to do as much of this project by myself. I really want to push myself to think about the problems I face and how to fix them. Excited to get started!

Another project down! Looking back there are a few things I did good and a few things I need to work on. Starting with the good, I spent a lot of time really working through each individual issue that happened. My main strategy was to walk away and explain the issue to a "teddy bear" often this lead me right to the answer I was looking for. This worked for awhile and I am really proud of what I was able to build. The issue I ran into was relying on weak conditionals and the overuse of 0 to verify variables. Admittly I had to take a look at how others approached this program. What I found when I looked was that I was extremely close, my logic was good but like I said the conditionals really made it confusing. I had to refactor my program to be alot more robust. My original operator function was doing a lot of the hard work which led to a few bugs that made me use the many conditionals. Overall this new version is alot more sturdy and I am happy to have completed it! If it is not obvious the CSS is designed after the IOS calculator.
